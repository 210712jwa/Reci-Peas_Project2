# Reci-Peas_Project2

Description
-----------------------------------
  - Reci-Peas is a web application which would allow users to put their own recipes into a collective database for purchase and/or to save for later.  Users as consumers would access recipes and be able to purchase ingredients for select recipes after creating an account.  Store users on the other hand would manage their produce and set their prices they want to sell at.
